Thankfully, the <b>Nobel Foundation</b> & [Nobelprize.org](http://www.nobelprize.org/) - is a registered trademark, and is produced, managed and maintained by Nobel Media, had created exactly the database of information for every Nobel Prize since 1901, including the Nobel Laureate's biographies, Nobel Lectures, interviews, photos, articles, video clips, and press releases. Nobelprize.org provides comprehensive, first-hand information about the Nobel Prize and Nobel Laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace starting in 1901, as well as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel and the Economics Laureates starting in 1969.
I would like to thanks, the 'Nobel Foundation' — had created exactly this dataset till 2016 of Nobel Prize Announcements.<br/><br/>Why, I have come to Nobel Foundation, because there wasn't any other place that had the data as nicely structured and informative.<br/><br/>Again the Nobel Foundation helped out by supplying a dataset with all of the Nobel Laureates from 1901.

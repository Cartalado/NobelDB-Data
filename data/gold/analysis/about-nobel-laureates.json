    "question": "\"Why are the individuals and organisations awarded a Nobel Prize called Nobel Laureates?\"",
    "answer": "\"The word 'Laureate' refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head. A laurel wreath is a circular crown made of branches and leaves of the bay laurel (in Latin: Laurus nobilis). In Ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour - both in athletic competitions and in poetic meets.\""
